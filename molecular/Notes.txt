NCBI:                       https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
    Sequences records and related information for numerous organisms (via RefSeq)
        NP_ prefix: protein
        NM_ prefix: mRNA
        NC_ prefix: genomic (usually reference assembly)
    Entrez as the interface into the data

    The major repository of 3D structural information about biological macromolecules

GenBank
    Contains all annotated and identified DNA sequence information
UniProt
    Universal Protein Resource8 is the most authoritative repos- itory of protein sequence data.

Data Formats
    GTF/GFF- interval formats
        Retain only coordinate positions for a region in a genome
        Tab delimited
        Info: chromosomal coordinate, start, end, strand, value, etc.
    SAM/BAM/CRAM- sequence alignment maps
        Represent alignment of FASTQ file to a reference FASTA file, describing individual pairwise alignments
        Compact Idiosyncratic Gapped Alignment Report (CIGAR) 
    VCF- variant call format
        Describes variation of alignments relative to a reference
        Typically created from a BAM file

Sequence Ontology
    Structural- Describes what a segment of DNA is
Gene Ontology
    Functional- Describes what a segment of DNA does

Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST)
    Partial match of the query sequence to a target sequence in the database
